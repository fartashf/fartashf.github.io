Fartash Faghri is a machine learning researcher at Apple Machine Learning 
Research (MLR). His research centers on enhancing the efficiency of foundation 
model training. Specifically, he has contributed to improving quality and 
effectiveness of training datasets, developing techniques for training 
on-device foundation models, and designing benchmarks and novel strategies for 
large-scale continual learning. Fartash joined Apple in 2021 following the 
completion of his PhD at the University of Toronto. His doctoral research 
delved into the development of fast and robust training methods.
